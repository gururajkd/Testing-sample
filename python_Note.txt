What is python:
--> it is a  general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language.
--> it is a open source

why python:
--> Easy to use and Learn
--> Interpreted Language
--> Object-Oriented Language
--> Open Source Language
--> Learn Standard Library
--> GUI Programming Support
--> Dynamic Memory Allocation
--> Wide Range of Libraries and Frameworks

Python used for:
--> Desktop Applications
--> Console-based Applications
--> Mobile Applications
--> Software Development
--> Web Applications
--> Enterprise Applications


Ex: in java [print Hello]
public class hello()
{
public static void main(strings[] args)
{
System.out.println("Hello")
}

Ex: in python [print Hello]
print("hello")

Python Identation:
--> it means space at the begining of the code.
--> it is used to identify the block of code.
--> minimum one space at the initial start of program
--> we can also default we can provide 4 blank space

python commants:
--to commants a statement in python we can use #
--> so if you add # before the statement it won't be executed

python Variable:
--> it is used to store the value
--> in python initally we will create variable and assign the value
ex:
x=10;
y="Robert"

python Variable Name:
--> variable name is short name or more descriptive name
--> it should start with letter or underscrore
--> it is case sensitive[age and AGE]
--> store or define multiple variable and value in a single line

python global variable:
--. it is used to access the variable from inside or outside the function.
--> it is created outside the function
--> anyone can access the variable
--. to create global variable use keyword " global"

Python Data Types:
--> it is used to store the different types of variable.
str: Text type

int , float , complex: Numeric type

list,tuple,range: Sequence type

dict: Mapping type

set,frozenset: Set type

bool: Boolean type

bytes,bytearray,memoryview: Binary type

Getting data type of any variable we can use type()
ex:
x=5;
print(type(x))

Set the data type:
x="Hello"
print(type(x))

python numbers:
there are three type of numbers

1.int [x=1]:
int or integer whole number positive or negative without decimal


2.float [x=2.5]:
float or floating point number , positive or negative 
containing one or more decimal values


3.complex [5J]:
--> complex numbers are written in "J" as a imaginary part

Random Number:
--> it is used to get or print some random number between the given range

string in python:
--> to define or declere the string we can use " str "
ex:
x=str("hello")

String are array:
x ="hello world"
print(x[1])

python slicing string:
--> it is used to get the some specific position to position of the string
--> we will specifiy the start and end index
ex:
a="hello,world"
print(a[2:6])

string modificationS:
1.Uppercase:
--> it is used to convert the string into upper case and print

2.lowerCase:
--> it is used to convert the string into lower case and print it

3.Remove white space:
--> it is used to remove the white space before or after the actual text

4.Replace string:
--> it is used to replace new string into old string

5.Split string

String concatenation:
--> it is use to cimbine 2 strings.

python Operators:
--> operators are used to perform some specific operations.
--> it is also used to make the code more logic

types of operators:
1.Arithmetic operators:
--> it is used for mathematical operation
[Add ,Multi,Sub,Division,Modules,]

2.Assignement operators:
--> it is used to assign the values and perform the operations.
[== ,< , > ,etc...]

3.Comparision operators;
--> it is used to compare two condition or logics
[== , != , > , < ,>=,<=]

4.Logical operators:
--> it is used to compare with muliple conditions
[AND , OR , NOT]

5.Identity operators:
--> it is not only check whether both are equal but it will also check both are same object or not
[is : it return true if both the variable have same object]
[is not: if both the variable object is not same then it will return true]

6.Membership operators:
--> it will used verify if the sequence is present in the object or not
[in: Return true if a sequence with the specified value is present]
[not in: Return true if the sequence with the specified value not present]

7.Bitwise operator


Condotional statement:
--> it is used to used to execute the code according to to given logic.
--> how the program should be executed
--> how the program should not executed

1.if: this statement is executed if the given condition is true

2.Elif: This stetament will be executed when the prevoius statement got failed

3.Else: This statement will be exexuted when the the prevoius all condition are not true

Python loops:
--> loop is used to execute code morethan one iteration
--> it will stop executing once the code reached the given condition

python has two  primitive loops:
1. while loop:
--> while loop can execute a set of conditions as long as condituion is true
--. it will come out of the loop once it reached the condition
ex:
while(condition)
{
// block of code
}

2. for loop
--> it is a most common iterator in python oops
--> using for loop we can execute a set of statement once for each item in a list

ex:
testing =["testing","java","python"]
for x in testing:
print(x)

the range():
--> loop through a set of code a specified no.of time
--> the range() starting from index 0 by default.
--> and increment by 1

Python List:
--> it is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
--> we will store the items inside a square bracket
syntax:
listname=["v1" ," v2", " v3"]

--> list items can be access using array index value starts with 0.
--> list items can be changeable
--> list can accept the duplicates.

python collection framework:
1.List: 
--> is a collection which is oredered and changeable.
--> allows duplicates.
syntax:
mylist=["values"]


2.Tuple:
--> is a collection which is oredered and unchangeable.
--> Allows duplicates records.
syntax:
mytuple=("values")


3.Set:
--> is a collection which is unordered and unchangable
--> no duplicates records.
syntax:
myset ={"values"}


4.Dictinoary:
--> is a collection which is ordered and ahangeable.
--> no duplicates records
--> it is used to store pair value means it will store key & value

python Functions:
--> a function is a block of code which only run when we call
--> you can pass a data,known as paramter
--> a functiona can have return value
--> to create a function we can use keyword def
ex:
def myfunction1():
 print("welcome to function")

call the function:
--> just write the name of the function
myfunction()

python Array:
--> it is used to store group or more than one values to single variable.
--> it is a special variable
--> to create array we will use square bracket []

ex:
course =["testing","java","selenium"]

Array Methods:
1.append(): add element at the end of the list

2.clear(): remove all elements from the list

3.copy(): returns a copy of list

4.count(): return the no.of elements with the specified value

5.extend(): one list elements will be addedd to another list

6.index():return the index of the first element with the specified value

7.insert(): add an element at the specified position

8.pop(): remove the element from the specified path

9.remove(): remove the item with the specified value

10.reverse(): reverse the order of the list

11.sort(): it is used to sort the array list


python Math():
--> it is a built-in function
--> it is used to perform mathematical operations.
1.min(): it is used to get the minimum values on the given set

2.max(): it is used to get the maximum from the given set

3.abs(): it will return absolute [positive] value

4.pow(x,y): this value return the x power of y

Math module:
--> it is used to conduct the mathematical calcualtion.
--> we have to import this class 
ex: 
import math

python dates:
--> it is inbuild function
--> it is used to print system date & time
--> to get work with current system date and time we ned to import datetime
ex:
import datetime
x=datetime.datetime.now()
print(x)

strftime():
--> it is used to custamized the or format the date , month ,year.
x=datetime.datetime.now()
print(x.year)
print(x.strftime("%A"))

ex:
%a: weakdays in short

%A: weekdays in full version

%w: weekdays in 0-6

%d: day of moth 0-31

%b: month name in short

%B: month name in full version

%y: year in short

%Y: year in full version


python Class:
--> python is a object-oriented programming language
--> in python everything is an object with its properties & methods
-->  a class is a blueprint of object

what is object:
-->collection of data[ or variable]

what is class:
--> it's a blue print of object

--> class will be created using " class" keyword
ex:
class myclass:
 x=5

create object:
--> we can create an object using class name
ex:
p1=myclass()
print(p1.x)

The _init_() Function:
--> _init_() function will always executed when the class being initiated
--> it is used to assgin the value to the object
--> instead of declaring variable in class level
--> we are declering inside the function called init()
--> self parameter  is a reference to the current instance of the class.
--> it is used to access the variable to belongs to the class

python Inheritance:
--> it is used for code reusability
--> we can use one class property & value to another class
Parent class:
--> the class being inherited, also called base class

chile class
--> the class inherits from another class , also called derived class

how to create parent class:
--> simply we can create using class keyword

How to create child class:
--> create child class which will inherits from parent class

python File Handling:
--> it is used to handle the file operations.
1.Read File
2.Write File
3.Create File
4.Delete File
--> using file handling we can create , update , delete files.
--> the key function for working with file is open()
--> the open() takes 2 parameter[filename,mode]

types of file modes:

"r" : Read: it is used to read a file if the file doesn't exist it will throw error

"a" : Append: open a file for appending 

"w": Write: open the file for writting

"x": Create: it is used to create new file

"t" : it represnt text file type
"b": binary type file [ex:image]

syntax: to open file
f =open("filename.txt")

or
f =open("filename.txt","rt")


python Exception Handling:
--> run time exception handled by python
--> how python is going to handle the run time exception

Exception Handling methods:

try: this block is used to test the condition

except: this block is used to handle the error

else: This block executes when there is no error

finally: this block will be executed depend the result of try and except


python RegEx:
--> Regular Expression is used to search .
--> it is called search pattern
--> it is used to replace the dynamic text using regex.
--> to implement reg Ex we need to import re

Types of Metacharacters:
. ---> [ any charcter]
